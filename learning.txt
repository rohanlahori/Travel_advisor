React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the 
reusable part from a functional component.

use State in React :

Continuously update the state of the application as the user interacts with the 
application.


The useState hook allows us to create state variables for our component. 
State variables are used to store dynamic data in our component which can change 
as a user interacts with it. One example of state would be the contents of a 
form that the user is filling out. As they interact with the form fields, 
the component is continuously 
updating its state and re-rendering in order to keep the form data up to date.
